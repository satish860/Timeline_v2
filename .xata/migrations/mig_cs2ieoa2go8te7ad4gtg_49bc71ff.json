The plaintiff, Dinesh Madan, claims a 50% share based on a gift deed from his mother (PG:9), while defendants Anil and Sunil Madan contest this, citing an oral family settlement granting Anil sole possession (PG:23).  Anil filed a counterclaim, alleging forged documents and seeking partition of other jointly owned properties (PG:115).  Defendant 2, Sunil, largely agrees with the plaintiff's claim (PG:67).  The court ordered valuation reports for the properties, which were submitted (PG:128, PG:134-159).  The case involves complex claims of fraud, forged documents, and conflicting interpretations of ownership and familyÂ agreements."
